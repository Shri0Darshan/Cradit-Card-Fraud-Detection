Project Title: Fraud Detection in Credit Card Transactions 
Abstract: Fraud detection in credit card transactions involves 
identifying suspicious activities within financial datasets. Using 
machine learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Decision 
Trees, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes, the system classifies 
transactions as fraudulent or legitimate. The key challenge is 
handling imbalanced datasets, where fraudulent cases are rare. 
Performance metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score help 
evaluate model effectiveness. The model can be enhanced with 
techniques like SMOTE to address class imbalance, making it 
suitable for real-time fraud detection.
